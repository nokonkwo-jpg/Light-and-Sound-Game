2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The main challenge I encountered in creating this submission was the simultaneous task of learning JavaScript on the fly while feeling an overwhelming urge to perfect my code.

To overcome this challenge, I came up with an iterative approach. Instead of trying to learn JavaScript thoroughly before starting the coding process, I started by implementing basic functionalities and gradually delved deeper into the language as needed. As I started to better understand the language, I’d also reward myself with a break, walking around to destress, and a warm, buttery croissant to get my energy up. Getting too wrapped up in code can be regressive. This allowed me to make progress with the project while continuously improving my understanding of JavaScript on a full stomach and clear mind.

I also resisted the urge to perfect every line of code from the beginning. Instead, I focused on building a foundation and then refined and optimized the code through each iteration. This approach helped me manage the learning curve and ensured that the project was progressing smoothly.

Instead of just conquering a challenge, learning JavaScript became a stimulating experience I eagerly embraced throughout the project. By breaking down the challenge into smaller, manageable pieces and continuously refining my code, I balanced the need for learning with the desire for perfection, ultimately leading to a successful submission.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How do web developers utilize techniques like A/B testing or user surveys to gain insights into user preferences for specific design elements or functionality on a website? I'm especially curious about incorporating feedback from everyday users who aren't necessarily content creators/sponsored individuals, and how these insights can be used to optimize the website for a wider audience? Another question that came to mind relates to expanding my understanding of front-end technologies. While I found HTML/CSS/JavaScript to be the core trio, I'm curious about the existence and potential value of other languages that could work alongside them. Specifically, since JavaScript is interpreted, I wonder if other interpreted languages like Java or Python could theoretically be used to build websites as well. My interest stems from wanting to explore the options available and understand the trade-offs involved in choosing different languages for this purpose.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add a couple more features. When I occasionally play video games, I try to find the easiest way to the goal. A cheat code I found when playing the project was that if you were quick enough, you could press the buttons as they were flashing, defeating the purpose of the game —— memory. So I’d add a feature where you can’t press until all signals are played.

Although the initial task was to replicate the basic functionality of the game, I recognized the opportunity to exceed expectations. I took the chance to personalize the project by adding extra features that were nostalgic to me. Bright, neon buttons and 8-bit tunes in the background reminded me of the arcade games I used to play at the car wash near my house. I also implemented user-friendly controls and some memes to capture broader audiences.

I am also interested in implementing adaptive difficulty levels. This difficulty adjustment system would be based on the user's performance. As the player progressed, the difficulty would increase, thus challenging and engaging them. I’d also add a player vs player option so that you can play against a friend. One player sets the pattern and you have to repeat it. To appeal to those who are musically inclined, I’d add an option that is sound-based, so that the only cues you’d have are the notes being played!
